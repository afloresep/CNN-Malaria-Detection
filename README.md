## Overview
This project aims to classify red blood cell images for malaria infection detection and species classification. It utilizes deep learning techniques to train models that can distinguish between infected and uninfected cells, as well as predict the species of the malaria parasite causing the infection.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria). It includes a collection of labeled red blood cell images, categorized as infected or uninfected. Additionally, the dataset provides species labels for the infected cells.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/malaria-detection.git
   cd malaria-detection


Install required dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


Usage
Download the dataset and organize it within the data/ directory.

Preprocess the data using the scripts in the src/data_preprocessing/ directory.

Train the main malaria infection detection model using the scripts in the src/train/ directory.

Train the species classification model using the scripts in the src/train/ directory.

Evaluate the model's performance using the scripts in the src/evaluate/ directory.

Experiment with different configurations, architectures, and hyperparameters to achieve the best results.
